Slate.js

Slate is a completely customizable framework for building rich text editors. Slate lets you build rich, intuitive editors like those in Medium, Dropbox Paper or Google Docs—which are becoming table stakes for applications on the web—without your codebase getting mired in complexity.

We use Slate as the backbone of Stempad's editor. It's flexibility and configurability has been instrumental in building an editor with the custom features and blocks needed for Stempad's user experience.

MathQuill

"MathQuill is an open source formula editor for the Web maintained by @laughinghan and @stufflebear. MathQuill was born of a need to communicate math. The creators, @laughinghan and @jneen, used LaTeX for projects together, but struggled to collaborate online once they were apart. They wanted a tool to both write and read math without resorting to ugly flat text or more cumbersome conventions."

We use MathQuill to power our Math block. It's the fastest and most intuitive web based math editor.
